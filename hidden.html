<h1>The Final Button!</h1>
<p class = "final-text"> <img class = "fake" src = "images/Boo.png" ALIGN = "right"> So, you finally got to the last puzzle. well there is a button at the bottom
of the page.... but you are smart. you probably knew it isn't actually the real button. Then again, maybe you actually aren't all that smart.
Regardless i wanted to give you a clue about the whereabouts of the button. You see, ive decided to incorporate the past puzzles into 1. For example, the first puzzle's secret was that buttons would dissapear if it was the wrong one. This time its the opposite. This time someting will actually dissapear that you in order to find the hiddden button.
second, you may have realized that the "it" link didnt appear as a link, nor will this button. in fact i might just play mind games with you XD. Honestly, i dont know what II  am saying anymore....Good luck!
